# Back-N-Forth
Code base for reproducing experimental results for the proposed Back-N-Forth algorithm.

To run the automatic evaluation, download the checkpoints, unzip them and run
```bash
   python main.py --eval_mode=True
```

To run the interactive demo, run:
```bash
   python main.py --start_server=True
```

To train a model on your own machine, simply run:
```bash
   python main.py
```
